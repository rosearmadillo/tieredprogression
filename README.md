# TieredProgression
## About
A Minecraft mod about redefining the core progression to be more tiered and include copper.

## Changes
Enchanting Tables now require an End Dragon Egg
Netherite scraps are now smelted in a "Nether Furnace" which requires a Nether Star as burns Dragon's Breath
Iron spawns lower (+32 to -32) rather than near surfance levels and requires copper tools to mine.
